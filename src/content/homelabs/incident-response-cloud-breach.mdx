## Management Hypervisor

The central piece of my lab is a dedicated host running **Proxmox VE.**

**Host Name: pve-01**
- **Model:** HP EliteDesk 800 G1 SFF
- **CPU:** Intel Core i5-4590 (4 Cores, up to 3.70 GHz)
- **RAM:** 12GB DDR3
- **Storage:** 480GB seconds
- **Hypervisor:** Proxmox VE

## Network Backbone

My setup contains a mix of consumer and enterprise systems.

- **Cisco WS-3750-24PS-S (Core Switch):** This is a 24-port Layer 3 enterprise switch. It doesn't run 24/7 but I use it to manage VLANs and test other network functions.
- **Gateway:** Handles my primary connection to the ISP and provides the initial routing for my setup.

## The Final Piece

While the HP Desktop handles the heavier virtualization, my **Raspberry Pi 5 (4GB)** covers the rest. I've upgraded it with a **NVME/PoE Hat**, allowing it to boot from a higher speed SSD with a single Ethernet cable.

### Current Services Running:

- **Pi-hole:** Network-wide DNS ad-blocking
- **Minecraft Server:** Dedicated instance for multiplayer
- **Obsidian Sync:** A self-hosted backend for multi platform support
- **Home Page:** A central dashboard to monitor the health and links of all lab services
- **Tailscale:** My VPN for secure remote acceess to the lab from anywhere

## Next Steps:

My next goal is to expand the Prommox cluster with automated monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana. Also for the HP Desktop, I look to upgrade the ram to 32GB DDR3 for improved function.
